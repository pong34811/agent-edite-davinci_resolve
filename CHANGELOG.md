# Changelog

## v0.4.0

### Added
- `scripts/load_subtitle_preset.py`: loads a saved Subtitle track preset (Inspector > Load Preset) by script. Resolve 21.1 has no preset API, so it copies the preset bytes (`User.db` `SubtitlePresetsBA`) into each target track's `EffectFiltersBA` in `Project.db`. Dry run by default; `--apply` saves, exports a `.drp`, closes the project, snapshots `Project.db`, writes one transaction, reopens, restores timeline/playhead/page and verifies blobs and cue counts.
- `--orientation horizontal|vertical` selects timelines by resolution (Mitr Font for 16:9, Mitr-short-001 for 9:16 in the user's library).
- `tests/test_load_subtitle_preset.py`: offline tests for blob parsing/round-trip and exact-row database writes.

### Verified
- Applied `Mitr Font` to 10/10 subtitle tracks of project `tygarina_2026-09-30_FreeTalk_1` (8 changed, 2 already matching); cue counts unchanged; repeat dry run reports 0 changes. The vertical path is dry-run tested only.

## v0.2.0

### Added
- `resolve-video-enrichment/references/adjustment-focus.md`: using the user's selected Adjustment Clip as a protected template (selection readback, copy rather than move, per-timeline templates) and a 9-point per-cue VTuber framing checklist (subtitle association, new-track placement, prominence, centering, head-to-chest/hands, headroom, no crop, caption/HUD overlap, scope audit).
- `resolve-video-enrichment/references/illustration-assets.md`: planning, rights, organization, import, placement, and QC of still-image overlays.
- KT404 enrichment tooling: `scripts/enrichment_assets.py`, `scripts/enrichment_engine.py`, `scripts/run_pilot.py`, with tests, plus the design spec and implementation plans under `docs/superpowers/`.
- Working references and QC evidence under `reference/` and `scratch/`.

### Updated
- Synced `resolve-video-enrichment` with the live Hermes copy: per-timeline `timelineFrameRate` for record/source conversions, full-length BGM and 1.5–2.5s GIF holds, and new Thai trigger phrases.
- Bundle manifest checksums and counts refreshed for the release contents.

### Scope
- No claim of live Resolve verification for the new guidance; the pilot tooling's own results are recorded in `WORKLOG.md`.

## v0.1.0

First versioned release of the DaVinci Resolve editing skill bundle. The bundle version is independent of Resolve, the upstream MCP server, and individual archived skill versions.

### Added
- Thai VTuber editorial guidance: selecting self-contained highlights, truthful hooks, comic timing, and preserving the creator's personality.
- On-demand chapters for Resolve editing, Thai captions/audio/framing, YouTube packaging/feedback, and delivery/rights, with primary-source references.
- A reusable edit brief, cutlist, experiment plan, and acceptance-record template.

### Updated
- Expanded `resolve-video-enrichment` into a lean core with 11 reference chapters and one template, retaining the existing enrichment/recovery workflows.
- Clarified native subtitles versus burned-in pixels, evidence-led cue placement, measured audio versus scripting capability, source-frame timebases, and approval-gated repair/cleanup.
- Preserved the project's native Subtitle-track workflow and Thai short-form limits: three short words/about 14 Thai characters, at most 1.5 seconds, and no spaces between Thai words except appropriate Latin boundaries.
- Refreshed bundle provenance/checksums and validation evidence for the release contents.

### Fixed
- Bundle validation now accepts Git's LF/CRLF conversion for UTF-8 text while still rejecting content changes and preserving exact binary checksums; regression tests cover both newline directions and binary changes.

### Scope
- Skills, documentation, and bundle-validation release only: no MCP implementation, Resolve project, source media, or live editing behavior was changed.
- No claim of proven audience growth, channel-specific analytics, or live Resolve verification.
- Unrelated local editing plans, worklogs, scratch reports, media, and project backups are not part of this release change.
